Welcome to my web-page! I am a senior engineer at Ant Group.  My area of interest includes static analyse, symbolic execution and verification. 

Before join Ant Group in 2021, my main research topic has been symbolic execution of MPI program, see my [publications](https://xianjinfu.github.io/publications/) if you want.
