MPI is widely used in high performance computing. In this extended abstract, we report our current status of analyzing MPI programs. Our method can provide coverage of both input and non-determinism for MPI programs with mixed blocking and non-blocking operations. In addition, to improve the scalability further, a deadlock-oriented guiding method for symbolic execution is proposed. We have implemented our methods, and the preliminary experimental results are promising.
